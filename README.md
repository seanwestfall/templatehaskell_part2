Template Haskell Part 2
=====================

This is the second part to the [Template Haskell guide](https://github.com/seanwestfall/templatehaskell/blob/master/README.md) I wrote for Oliver Charles' [24 Days of GHC Extensions](https://ocharles.org.uk/blog/).

In the first part, I only gave an overfew of the syntax and Template Haskell's basic approach meta-programming. In this second part, I'll cover quasi-quoting and also some more practical examples of how to use TH to create syntax extension.
